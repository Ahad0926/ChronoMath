          Dissemination Through Islamic Lands and Latin Europe
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          The treatise spread across the Islamic world through copies and commentaries.
          Around the 12th century, it reached Europe via Latin translations (commonly
          attributed to translators such as Gerard of Cremona). These translations introduced
          the systematic treatment of equations into Western mathematics.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Influence on Later Mathematicians</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          <strong>Symbolic Notation:</strong><br />
          While Al-Khwarizmi himself wrote in rhetorical style, his concepts of “roots,”
          “squares,” and “numbers” were instrumental in the future development of symbolic
          notation.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          <strong>Standard Form:</strong><br />
          The idea that any quadratic equation could be simplified to a standard form is
          still how we teach solving quadratics today (i.e., rewriting everything as
          <code>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</code>).
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          <strong>Completing the Square:</strong><br />
          This technique, explicitly illustrated by Al-Khwarizmi, is taught in contemporary
          classrooms worldwide as a standard method for deriving the quadratic formula or
          for solving quadratics when factoring is not straightforward.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Legacy</h2>
        <p>
          Al-Khwarizmi's systematic procedure of “completion and balancing” outlines many of
          the steps students learn for solving quadratic equations. His geometric demonstrations
          still appear in textbooks today to provide an intuitive rationale for the algebraic
          manipulations. Through the Latin West, his book influenced Renaissance mathematicians
          and eventually became a foundational reference in the evolution of modern algebra
          textbooks.
