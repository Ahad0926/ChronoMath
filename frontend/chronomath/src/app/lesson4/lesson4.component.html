            Dissemination Through Islamic Lands and Latin Europe
          </h2>
          <p>
            The treatise spread across the Islamic world through copies and commentaries.
            Around the 12th century, it reached Europe via Latin translations (commonly
            attributed to translators such as Gerard of Cremona). These translations introduced
            the systematic treatment of equations into Western mathematics.

            Influence on Later Mathematicians
          </h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Symbolic Notation:</strong><br />
            While Al-Khwarizmi himself wrote in rhetorical style, his concepts of “roots,”
            “squares,” and “numbers” were instrumental in the future development of symbolic
            notation.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Standard Form:</strong><br />
            The idea that any quadratic equation could be simplified to a standard form is
            still how we teach solving quadratics today (i.e., rewriting everything as
            <code>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</code>).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Completing the Square:</strong><br />
            This technique, explicitly illustrated by Al-Khwarizmi, is taught in contemporary
            classrooms worldwide as a standard method for deriving the quadratic formula or
            for solving quadratics when factoring is not straightforward.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">
            Legacy
          </h2>
          <p>
            Al-Khwarizmi's systematic procedure of “completion and balancing” outlines many of
            the steps students learn for solving quadratic equations. His geometric demonstrations
            still appear in textbooks today to provide an intuitive rationale for the algebraic
            manipulations. Through the Latin West, his book influenced Renaissance mathematicians
            and eventually became a foundational reference in the evolution of modern algebra
            textbooks.
