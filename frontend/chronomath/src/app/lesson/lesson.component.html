        <!-- LESSON 1 CONTENT -->
        <p class="mb-4">
          In 820 CE, under the Abbasid Caliphate during the Islamic Golden Age,
          Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, known more commonly as simply Al-Khwarizmi,
          published his treatise detailing various concepts in elementary algebra
          known as
          <em>al-Kitāb al-Mukhtaṣar fī Ḥisāb al-Jabr wal-Muqābalah</em>
          (<strong>الكتاب المختصر في حساب الجبر والمقابلة</strong>),
          translated as <em>The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing</em>,
          more simply known as <strong>Al-Jabr</strong> (الجبر).
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          His primary focus was detailing how to deal with everyday issues regarding inheritance,
          commercial transactions, and the distribution of legacies, which oftentimes required
          calculations with unknown variables. As such, his goal was to codify a clear, step by step
          methodology for how to solve what is now known as linear and quadratic equations.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          The treatise itself contained accounts of solving for positive roots of polynomial equations,
          explaining what they are as an idea through more simple linear equations, up to the second
          degree. He also introduced the process of “reducing” and “balancing” equations, which is
          actually related to the definitions of “Al-Jabr” itself (Completion and Balancing), as well as
          moving subtracted terms on one side of an equation to the opposite side of the equal sign,
          also known as cancelling like terms on opposite sides of the equation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Al-Jabr was prominently the first piece of text to teach algebra for the sake of it, and being
          the etymological namesake of the English word derived from it (Al-Jabr into Algebra), has a
          profound importance in relation to standardized algebra today, particularly the application of
          solving for the unknown in a polynomial equation, specifically linear and quadratic equations.
